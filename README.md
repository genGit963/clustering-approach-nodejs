# Clustering Approach in Node.js

This project demonstrates a clustering approach in Node.js for optimizing performance in multi-core systems by distributing workload across multiple child processes. Using Node.js's built-in clustering module, this project enhances application scalability by enabling efficient handling of concurrent tasks.
